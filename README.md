# OneWork
## _A Web App to streamline recruitment processes_

# About the Project

OneWork was a project made by [Alberto] and [Luis] and deployed in a homemade environment, in order to add precision and agility to their hiring process work and that of their friends and above all to practice. Nonprofit.

Version control was managed with Git, and project management was done with GitLab.

The homemade server was programmed to save power by automatically shutting down each night. This was achieved through a Ubuntu Server configuration and settings in the BIOS.

It's highly likely that the no-ip URLs for the pre-production and production environments are no longer related to this project or do not exist.

## Features

With this tool, users will be able to:

- Create an account as a recruiter or worker.
- Post job Offers.
- View the Offers on a fully public Kanban board.

_Additionally, there was a plan to create a video call system using WebRTC for conducting interviews, but it was never implemented._

## State management

Click the [üëÅ] button on the main screen to view the status in the browser console.

_The simulated version of the API integrated into the front-end project (npm run mockClient) has been discontinued and is no longer functional. Therefore, this project can only be executed by setting up the backend and the database. However, if you're interested in seeing an example of the State Management used, you can easily deploy [this another project](https://github.com/caballeroluis/rxjs-state-management-and-json-server) of mine where the front-end API mock is working._
